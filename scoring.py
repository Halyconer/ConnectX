    Remember how minimax works: The algorithm recursively explores all possible moves up to a certain depth. It picks a maximizing move, 
    then it assumes the opponent will pick the minimizing move, and so on. The depth is a limit to how many moves ahead the algorithm will look.

    The algorithm will then return a score of the board state for the maximizing player. If the maximizing player is the AI, it will return a positive score for a win,
    a negative score for a loss, and 0 for a draw.
