'''
Connect4 initial game implementation with the goal of implementing a basic minmax-based AI.
At the moment, the player always goes first, and the AI randomly selects a column.

Another objective is to have a 6x7x2x2 matrix: layered matricies to evaluate the board state, which will allow for a more sophisticated AI.

To do list:
1. Move all scoring logic to scoring.py
2. Fix magic number issue

Notes:
- drop_piece method is kind of redundant, although it might be more efficient because it allows for a single method to handle the piece dropping logic. Need to 
make sure that it is implemented because some methods just use array assignment.
- Currently board references are very confusing as to when the numpy array or the Connect4 object is being referenced.
